# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-JS
This is my first JavaScript program that I recently completed watching YouTube tutorials and here, I have made a 3x3 (3 rows, and 3 columns) Tic-Tac-Toe game. In this game, the user is able to click a button (sqaure) and for the first player, 'O' is used and for the second player, 'X' gets used. Also, during the middle of the game, the user is able to reset the game and after completing the game, the user will be able to play a new game. If 'O' player wins, then a message appears 'Congratulations, Winner is O' and likewise, it will be similar for player 'X' i.e., message will appear like 'Congratulations, Winner is X'. If the game is draw, then the user has to reset the game using the reset button. 
Enjoy the Game!!!!
